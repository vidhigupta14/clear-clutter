# File Organizer

This is a simple Node.js script that organizes files in a folder by their extensions.  
It automatically creates folders for each extension (e.g., `.txt`, `.jpg`, `.js`) and moves the files into their respective folders.

## What it uses
- **Node.js**
- **fs** module (for file system operations)
- **path** module (for handling file and folder paths)

## Purpose
This was a mini exercise in my learning journey to practice working with Node.js file system operations.
